1. What was Stroustrup's conclusion?
   [What Should We Teach New Software Developers? Why?]
   (4 pts)

We must shrink the academia/industry gap by making changes on both sides.
My suggestion is to define a structure of CS education based on a core plus
specializations and application areas, aiming eventually at licensing of
software artifacts and at least some of the CS professionals who produce
them. This might go hand-in-hand with an emphasis on lifelong
industry/academia involvement for technical experts.
