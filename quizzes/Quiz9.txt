"At least one of these software modifications was the introduction of a
subroutine for converting clock-time more accurately into floating-point.
This calculation was needed in about half a dozen places in the program,
but the call to the subroutine was not inserted at every point where it was
needed. Hence, with a less accurate truncated time of one radar pulse being
subtracted from a more accurate time of another radar pulse, the error no
longer cancelled."
